## üß† Algorithms

### 1. **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
- **Data Structure**: Queue (FIFO)
- **Strategy**: Explores all neighbors at current depth before moving deeper
- **Guarantee**: Finds shortest path in unweighted graphs
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V)
- **Best For**: Unweighted graphs, shortest path guarantee needed

### 2. **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
- **Data Structure**: Stack (LIFO)
- **Strategy**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- **Guarantee**: Does NOT guarantee shortest path
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V)
- **Best For**: Exploring all paths, memory-efficient depth exploration

### 3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- **Data Structure**: Priority Queue (Min-Heap)
- **Strategy**: Always explores the least-cost node first
- **Guarantee**: Finds shortest path in weighted graphs
- **Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V)
- **Best For**: Weighted graphs with non-negative weights

### 4. **A\* (A-Star)**
- **Data Structure**: Priority Queue with Heuristic
- **Strategy**: Uses Manhattan distance heuristic to guide search toward goal
- **Guarantee**: Finds shortest path (with admissible heuristic)
- **Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V)
- **Best For**: Goal-directed search, optimal performance in many scenarios
- **Heuristic**: `h(n) = |x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ| + |y‚ÇÅ - y‚ÇÇ|` (Manhattan distance)

## üîß Technical Details

### Configuration Parameters

```python
CELL_SIZE = 15          # Pixel size of each maze cell
MAZE_WIDTH = 45         # Number of cells horizontally
MAZE_HEIGHT = 45        # Number of cells vertically
FPS = 60                # Animation frame rate
```

**Window Size**: 675x675 pixels (45 cells √ó 15 pixels)

### Maze Generation

- **Algorithm**: Recursive Backtracking (DFS-based)
- **Process**:
  1. Start with a grid full of walls
  2. Carve paths by randomly removing walls
  3. Use stack-based DFS to ensure perfect maze (one solution)
  4. Guarantees connectivity from start to end

### Path Reconstruction

The `reconstruct_path()` function traces backwards from the end point using parent pointers:

```python
visited = {cell: parent_cell}  # Each cell stores its parent
# Walk backward: end ‚Üí parent ‚Üí parent ‚Üí ... ‚Üí start
```

### Performance Metrics

- **Path Length**: Number of cells in the final path (excluding start)
- **Execution Time**: Wall-clock time from search start to completion (in seconds)

### Algorithm Comparison

**BFS (Blue)** - Explores uniformly in all directions
```
Pros: Guarantees shortest path, systematic exploration
Cons: Explores many unnecessary cells
```

**DFS (Red)** - Dives deep into one direction
```
Pros: Memory efficient, fast initial exploration
Cons: No shortest path guarantee, can take wrong paths
```

**Dijkstra (Green)** - Optimal for weighted graphs
```
Pros: Shortest path guarantee, handles weighted edges
Cons: Explores in all directions (slower than A*)
```

**A\* (Yellow)** - Guided by heuristic toward goal
```
Pros: Fastest to goal, optimal path, heuristic-guided
Cons: Requires good heuristic function
```
